            Mechanical keyboards offer a superior typing experience compared to
            traditional membrane keyboards. They are known for their durability,
            tactile feedback, and customizable features. Each key on a
            mechanical keyboard uses a separate mechanical switch, which
            provides a more satisfying and responsive typing experience.

            These keyboards are built to last, with many models rated for tens
            of millions of keystrokes. This makes them ideal for gamers,
            writers, and anyone who spends a lot of time at their computer.

            and switches, allowing users to tailor the feel and look of their
            keyboard to their personal preferences.
